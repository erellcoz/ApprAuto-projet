This project consists of different files, described as follows:

xgboost-gbr.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the ModelSelector class, which can be used to fine-tune hyperparameters on the pipeline and the model. It is based on various functions. There is also another class named ModelSelectorSemiSupervised, which allows for testing a model using a self-learning method and also for choosing a confidence threshold to determine whether we keep the predicted data in the final dataset.
